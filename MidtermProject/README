1. To compile the program, we used the command "make" and the Makefile took
care of the specifics. Then to actually run the program, we used the command
"./main".

Additional Comments:
-In our Makefile, we included the flag "-O2". This flag shortens the runtime
of our program which is beneficial because functions such as sharpen, blur,
and edge detection otherwise take up to 25 seconds to run. However, I just
wanted to note that even with this flag, using valgrind can still take up to
5 minutes if the user uses the sharpen function with large sigma/intensity
parameters.

-There are a lot of places where errors of occur and it is possible we didn't
catch everything. We included error detection tests at the following places:
      a. if the user tries to read from a file that doesn't exist
      b. if reading or writing an image fails
      c. if the parameters given for a function are correct but the
      	 parameters would cause an error; an example would be cropping
	 outside the boundaries of an image or trying to use the contrast
	 function with a paramter of 0
      d. if the user tries to use any of the functions before reading in a
      	 file first
      e. if the user gives incorrect parameters; an example would be giving
      	 a string when the function is expecting an int as a parameter

-We also implemented functions in menuUtil that remove possible spaces and
newlines that the user put between function calls and parameters
